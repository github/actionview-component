## Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I use other templating languages besides ERB?

Yes. ViewComponent is tested against ERB, Haml, and Slim, but it should support most Rails template handlers.

## Isn't this just like X library?

ViewComponent is far from a novel idea! Popular implementations of view components in Ruby include, but are not limited to:

* [trailblazer/cells](https://github.com/trailblazer/cells)
* [dry-rb/dry-view](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-view)
* [komposable/komponent](https://github.com/komposable/komponent)
* [activeadmin/arbre](https://github.com/activeadmin/arbre)
